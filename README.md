# StateTest
A map of the United States to test your knowledge

This is just me learning how SVG works and trying to get back into javascript

It is a simple map of the USA with a state at the top the user has to click on the correct state to turn it gold.
Click the wrong one and it turns black.  That state doesn't lock or anything eventually you'll find all the states.
